                <h4 class="text-design left-texts left-text-designs">Early Life</h4>
                <p class="text-design left-texts">
                    <bold>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</bold> was born into a Dalit (formerly known as "untouchable") family
                    and faced discrimination and social inequality from a young age due to the caste system prevalent in
                    India during that time. Despite these challenges, he pursued education vigorously and earned several
                    degrees, including a doctorate in economics from the University of London.

                <h4 class="text-design left-texts left-text-designs">Legal Career</h4>
                <p class="text-design left-texts">Ambedkar went on to become a renowned jurist and legal scholar. He
                    played a pivotal role in advocating for the rights of the Dalit community and was a strong proponent
                    of social justice and equality.</p>
                <h4 class="text-design left-texts left-text-designs">Architect of the Indian Constitution</h4>
                <p class="text-design left-texts">One of his most significant contributions was his role as the chairman
                    of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly of India. He played a key part in formulating
                    the Indian Constitution, which was adopted in 1950. His efforts ensured that the Constitution
                    enshrined principles of equality, social justice, and fundamental rights for all Indian citizens,
                    regardless of caste, religion, or gender.</p>
                <h4 class="text-design left-texts left-text-designs">Dalit Rights Movement</h4>
                <p class="text-design left-texts">Dr. Ambedkar was a tireless advocate for the rights of Dalits and
                    worked relentlessly to eradicate the practice of untouchability. He converted to Buddhism in 1956,
                    along with thousands of his followers, as a way to escape the caste system's oppressive constraints
                    and discrimination.</p>
                <h4 class="text-design left-texts left-text-designs">Political Career</h4>
                <p class="text-design left-texts">Ambedkar was also a prominent political figure. He was a member of
                    India's first cabinet after independence and held important portfolios, including Minister of Law
                    and Minister of Justice. He continued to champion the cause of social justice and Dalit empowerment
                    through his political career.</p>
                <h4 class="text-design left-texts left-text-designs">Legacy</h4>
                <p class="text-design left-texts">Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's legacy is immense. His ideas, writings, and
                    advocacy for the oppressed continue to inspire generations of Indians and social reform movements.
                    He is often referred to as the "Father of the Indian Constitution" and is celebrated as a symbol of
                    social justice and equality.
                    <br>

                    Dr. B.R. Ambedkar passed away on 6 December 1956 in New Delhi, leaving behind a lasting impact on
                    the social, political, and constitutional fabric of India. His contributions to the nation have
                    earned him widespread recognition and respect, and he remains an icon of social reform and progress
                    in India.
